# Program Name: Custom Stacks and Queues Implementation

## Author: Abhishek Shrestha

## Overview:
This C++ program showcases the implementation of custom stacks and queues without relying on standard libraries. It emphasizes operator overloading to introduce additional features, such as combining two stacks or queues. The program reads input from files, processes the data, sorts the structures, and prints the results.

## Program Description:
The program performs the following actions:
1. Implements custom stack and queue data structures.
2. Utilizes operator overloading to enhance functionality, such as combining two stacks or queues.
3. Reads input data from files.
4. Processes the data, including sorting the structures.
5. Prints the results.

## Instructions for Running the Program:
1. Compile the source code.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow on-screen prompts to input file names and perform operations.
4. Review the output to observe the results of data processing and structure operations.

## File Structure:
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function and program logic.
- Other source files: Contains implementations for custom stack and queue data structures.
- Input files: Contains sample input data for processing.

## Dependencies:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

## Notes:
- The program demonstrates the use of operator overloading to enhance the functionality of custom data structures.
- No reliance on standard library data structures is present, showcasing a self-contained implementation.
- Input files should be properly formatted and accessible for correct program execution.

## Future Improvements:
- Error handling for file input/output operations.
- Performance optimizations for large datasets.
- Additional features or functionalities for the custom stack and queue implementations.
